# Instacart-Basket-Analysis-Python

## Project Summary

This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Instacart's sales data with the goal of uncovering customer purchasing behaviors and providing actionable insights for targeted marketing. The analysis investigates key trends such as peak shopping times, spending habits, and product popularity by department.
A major focus is on customer segmentation — examining behavior across dimensions like loyalty status, region, age group, income, and family status. These insights are designed to help Instacart craft more personalized and effective marketing campaigns, enhance customer engagement, and boost sales performance.

## Key Questions

- What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day?
- At what times do customers spend the most money?
- With Instacart’s wide range of product prices, what recommendations can simplify price range groupings to better guide marketing efforts?
- Are there specific types of products that are more popular than others?
- How is brand loyalty distributed among users?
- Do ordering habits vary based on a customer’s loyalty status?
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
- Is there a connection between age and family status regarding ordering habits?
- What classifications can be derived from demographic information, such as age, income, types of goods, and family status?
- How do ordering habits differ among various customer profiles?

The data was analysed using Python and the following libraries:

● Pandas : for data analysis

● Numpy: for mathematical equations

● Seaborn: for data visulizations

● Matplotlib: for data visulizations

● Scipy: for data equations

## Folders

The project files are divided between the following folders:

 1.Project Management: Project Brief and Data Dictionary.

 2.Data: Separated into two subfolders Original Data and Prepared Data. These contains the original data frames and the data frames after they have been cleaned and prepared for analysis respectively. (Data files 
 not uploaded to GitHub due to size.)

 3.Scripts: The Jupyter notebooks containing the coding for the analysis.

 4.Analysis: The Visualizations folder contains the visualizations used for developing and explaining insights.

 5.Sent to Client: The final report presented in Excel.
